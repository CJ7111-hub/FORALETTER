    // The full text of your letter
    const fullText = `Hi ☺️ Today is Valentine’s Day. I hope you’re doing well today.  
I just want you to know how special you are to me.

Wait... Wait... I know what you might be thinking right now, but please hear me out.

First, I want to share a little bit about myself with you.  
You see all my life I feel like life has been unfair and harsh sometimes. I spend most of my time studying, trying my best to grow and improve, because I feel like it’s the only way I can repay my parents for all their sacrifices. I don’t want to fail them.

And if I’m being real… I also didn’t grow up feeling loved. I can’t even fully define what “love” feels like, because most of my life I’ve been alone isolated. I do have friends, but I’m usually quiet and I often prefer being alone. I used to think I could live my whole life independently, like I didn’t need anyone.

But deep inside, I’ve always wanted to experience what others have.  
To laugh, to feel free, to hurt, to suffer, to enjoy life, and to just feel normal.

Maybe that’s why I sometimes feel like life is harsh. I think it might be because of how I grew up. I didn’t have full control over my life, and I felt disconnected from the world. That’s why people always ask me, “Why are you so serious?” or “Why are you always quiet?” or “Why are you different?”  
And honestly… sometimes I also ask myself the same thing.

There are moments where I wonder if there’s something wrong with me… or if I’ll ever have the chance to experience a real relationship, or just live normally.

When I first met you, I didn’t think much about it. Not because I didn’t care it’s just how I am. I always told myself, “Nah, I’m not going to get into relationships.” My life is already messed up, I don’t want to drag anyone into it.

That’s also why whenever a girl interact to me, I don’t really know how to respond. The truth is… I get attached easily. So most of the time I just stay quiet, nod, and keep things simple.

Weird, I know… 😶


But somehow......., 


I ended up having the chance to talk to you someone who is kind, sweet, and genuine. And even though we barely knew each other, I felt lucky just being able to have small conversations with you.

Because honestly… those small moments made me happy.

You made me feel something I wasn’t used to.  
You showed me what the real world looks like.  
You made me understand things I never learned before.

In a way, you taught me how to love…  
to love myself, and to value other people.

You helped fix the doubts I had about myself.  
You made me feel like I have worth… like I matter… like I have a purpose.  
And you made my days better in ways you probably don’t even realize.

I really appreciate you.  
I’m genuinely thankful, and I’m happy that I got to know someone as kind as you.

I adore you from afar, and I truly respect the kind of person you are.  
Even when you try your best to stay strong, I can still see that you have struggles too. And honestly… it hurts me knowing that you sometimes carry things silently. I wish I could be the kind of person you could lean on when life feels heavy.

But at the same time, I keep reminding myself that maybe the distance between us has a purpose. Maybe it’s God’s way of protecting us, or teaching us something. Maybe there’s a reason why our paths crossed—why I got the chance to meet someone like you, even for a short time.

Because meeting you wasn’t something small for me.  
You became someone I genuinely care about.  
And whether you realize it or not, you left a mark in my life that I don’t think I can ever forget.

You’re always in my prayers.  
And sometimes I catch myself thinking of you randomly—during quiet moments, during stressful days, or even when I’m trying to focus. It’s strange, but it happens naturally… like you became a part of my thoughts without me even noticing.

So please take good care of yourself.  
Take care of your heart, your mind, and your peace.  
And when life gets hard, I hope you never forget that you are not alone, even if it feels like it sometimes.

More than anything, I want to see you achieve your goals and live the life you deserve. I want to see you happy, successful, and surrounded by people who truly appreciate you the way you deserve to be appreciated.

And if one day life becomes easier for you, I hope you’ll smile more, laugh more, and finally feel the kind of peace you’ve always wanted.

Thank you… for being you.  
Thank you for your kindness, your patience, and for making me feel that I matter.

I don’t know what the future holds, but I just want you to know this:  
I’ll always be proud of you, and I’ll always be grateful that I met you.
